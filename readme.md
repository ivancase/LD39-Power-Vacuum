Upload of my code and assets for my Ludum Dare 39 submission, Power Vacuum.

This game was created from scratch, when I was 16 years old, in 48 hours! The theme was "Running Out of Power". I aimed to make an experience very different from my previous projects and it was very fun to work on! Less so to play, hehe.

You can play it [here!](https://notiiivan.itch.io/power-vacuum)
